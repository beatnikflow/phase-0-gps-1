* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - I was struggling a bit with the pushing and pulling to github, I wasn't sure if I was doing it correctly. I was also still figuring out proper git workflow. 


*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - Git workflow made a lot more sense, as well as pushing and pulling to github. 


*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I had to ask the guide questions about fetching and merging, as those concepts were slightly confusing to me during the session. In the driving role, I was constantly asking my partner questions throughout the work to confirm that I was following her instructions properly and that she was satisfied with the code I input.  


*What still confuses you about Git?
    - I am still grasping all of the git concepts, which I know will become more familiar with time. Fetching and merging protocol is still a bit confusing to me. 


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - I think it went really well for our first time. I felt unsure and slightly nervous, but I know that's normal when working with something you're entirely confident with yet. I think the pace was great for the both of us, and we were able to communicate really well.
