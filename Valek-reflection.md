1. **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I think I was unsure about the proper way to coordinate the Git and GitHub workflows. The steps were mostly the same as in our week 1 work, so it was helpful to practice it again. I think with each assignment I'm getting more confident about the process.
2. **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
It was beneficial just seeing everything I learned in action while I worked with a partner. I didn't have a pairing session before this, so it was cool to see that we were both on the same page and suggesting the same things. I got clarification that I have been on the right track using commands so far.
3. **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked my pair and guide about the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`.
4. **What still confuses you about Git?**
I think I'm still confused when I should update my local repository when I'm working with a pair. The process of working with someone else is new to me, so I'm glad there will be lots of pair programming to practice that.
5. **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My experience was good. I was nervous, because I thought I'd feel like I was being graded all the time, but that wasn't the case. I appreciated my guide's laid-back style, and I think it helped me and partner connect and learn more since it was new experience for us.
